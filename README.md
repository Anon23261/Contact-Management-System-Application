#Contact-Management-System-Application

Explanation of Key Parts

1.	Data Structure: Contacts are stored in a list as dictionaries, where each dictionary has keys for name, phone, and email.
2.	Loop and Menu: main.py uses a while loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
3.	Error Handling: We use try-except blocks to handle invalid input when the user enters a choice that isnâ€™t an integer.
4.	String Manipulation: For searching and deleting, names are converted to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
How to Run

1.	Save contact_manager.py and main.py in the same directory.
2.	Run main.py by executing the following command in the terminal:
python main.py

This system is a solid foundation for managing contacts and demonstrates Python concepts like modules, functions, lists, dictionaries, and error handling effectively.
